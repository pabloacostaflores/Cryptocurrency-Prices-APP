# Cryptocurrency-Prices-APP
This is a mobile app where you can check by refreshing the page some of the most popular cryptocurrency prices. 
This app is made using React Native, Expo and the data is provided by an API called CoinGecko.

To run the app, you need to install https://docs.expo.io/ and node js, you also need an Android or IOS simulator, 
I have used a physical device connected by USB and download the Expo App on the Play Store, 
scan the QR code that expo brings you when running the command "expo start" on the directory you cloned the repository and thats it.
